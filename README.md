# gdp-per-capita-per-gold
# in this rep, we put the code that calculate the gdp per capita per gold in countries.




# GDP per capita is used by economists. But there is a question. If we remove USA inflation, how much is GDP per capita?

# in economical catch-up, we talk about a big catch-up in GDP per capita from 1960 - 1980, but when we calculate GDP per capita per gold, there is not any catchup in GDP per capita per gold from 1960-1980. because gold price pump sharply and the dollar lost its value from 1960 - 1980

# let's see strange results ...
